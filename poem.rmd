The room was suddenly rich and the great bay-window was  
Spawning snow and pink roses against it  
Soundlessly collateral and incompatible:  
World is suddener than we fancy it.  

World is crazier and more of it than we think,  
Incorrigibly plural. I peel and portion  
A tangerine and spit the pips and feel  
The drunkenness of things being various.  

And the fire flames with a bubbling sound for world  
Is more spiteful and gay than one supposes—   
On the tongue on the eyes on the ears in the palms of   one's hands—  
There is more than glass between the snow and the huge   roses.
